ci - merge different part of code continuosly into a single branch, commit->automated build->integration , jenkis
cdel - keep code ready fo deploymeny, build -> automated tests -> manual tests -> ready 
cdep -> deployment to end users, practice of deploying small changes to end users, instagram 
infrastructure as a code - managing infrastrcuture as a code , code infrastructure requirements->stored in code file
				->store in source contorl on a server ->run the file. example : code file to create 
				instance of new server or shift to a new server. earlier this was manual and was 
				tedius, with code everything is automated.
		earlier methods : either use manual process , or use cloud and GUI interface.
configuration management - a part of infrastructure as a code example: software pacakge\, configuration management tool
monitoring : collect data and present it in a pictorial format , in devops used to monitor performance of various
		services in infrastructure. uses : troubleshooting , website performance tracking
microservices : small parts of a huge program. Split the program into small parts. example : in ecommerce application
		cart, payment part, wishlist, authentication part, shopping, cuat detail etc.
		These microservices can be run on multiple nodes and need not but coded with the same programming 
		language. Microservices communicate with each other using standardised api.
		microservices make the project modular, as different parts are loosely coupled
